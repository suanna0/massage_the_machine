# Massage the Machine (2025)
For this project, I was interested in exploring the limitations of AI, particularly its interpreting and image labeling abilities. For example, before it was discontinued, the dataset ImageNet was notorious for labeling images in a way that perpetuated harmful stereotypes towards marginalized identities. 

Drawing inspiration from the essay, Excavating AI, and the art theory novel, The Medium is the Massage, this zine aims to educate the larger public on the limitations of AI. Upon careful examination, the root causes of these mistakes reveal a greater message about the language of seeing an image. The difficulty of formalizing the function where we see an image, interpret its meaning, then attach a label to it, is a testament to how powerful human language is. 

**Process:**
First, I’d like to start with this quote from Excavating AI which drew my attention. 

“When we look at the training images widely used in computer-vision systems, we find a bedrock composed of shaky and skewed assumptions. For reasons that are rarely discussed within the field of computer vision, and despite all that institutions like MIT and companies like Google and Facebook have done, the project of interpreting images is a profoundly complex and relational endeavor. Images are remarkably slippery things, laden with multiple potential meanings, irresolvable questions, and contradictions. Entire subfields of philosophy, art history, and media theory are dedicated to teasing out all the nuances of the unstable relationship between images and meanings.” —Crawford, Paglen

This quote made me want to investigate further–how can I educate the general public about how difficult of a task it is to formalize the complex semantics and ontological properties of the English language? This made me turn to The Medium is the Massage. In this book, McLuhan claims that the medium, the phonetic alphabet, is an abstraction that limits our communication. When we use a linear string of symbols to encode information, nuances are lost. As an aside, art theorist Rosalind Krauss argues that instead of using a linear structures, diagrams are a better representation of encoding information, particularly historical timelines. While a diagram is harder to parse through, it offers the ability to show history from multiple perspectives.

Next, I’d like to talk about the workings of mathematical reasoning–I believe that this image, taken from a 15-251 lecture, demonstrates it quite well. We build findings based from fundamental “truths.”

While mathematical reasoning is very powerful, it has its shortcomings–some math problems such as the Continuum Hypothesis cannot be solved with our current logical axioms. Additionally, Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem says that in any rule-based system of math, there will always be some true statements that can never be proven using those rules. 

**Final Result:**

The benefit of print media is that consumption takes place outside of algorithmic distribution, which is mostly in service to people in positions of power. A zine is printed on 8.5 x 11 paper, is black and white, so it is easy to photocopy and distribute. The short length and digestible syntax makes it easy to expose people to new ideas, inspiring curiosity to learn more.

**Reflection:**
Tech literacy is so important, especially with the distrust in higher education we are seeing in the current political climate. I hope that this work is a step towards demystifying the workings of AI in a way that is accessible.

I do not really consider myself a philosophy person so working on this was a really exhilarating push outside of my comfort zone. The research was super interesting–philosophy feels like a cousin to math–the readings satisfy my desire of seeing logical frameworks work together. 

Well, what’s next for my artwork? It's frustrating seeing engineers create tools without talking to artists first–creating software without having a fundamental understanding of how an artist's workflow looks like. It is also frustrating seeing the misrepresentation of computer science within the contemporary art space–while computers can be used for evil endeavors, at the end of the day, computers are not evil. A computer is a computer.
